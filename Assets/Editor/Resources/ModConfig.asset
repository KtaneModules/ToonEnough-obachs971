  description: "Are you toon enough?\n\nThanks to Royal_Flush, Timwi, EpicToast, and
    the rest of the modders helping me to create my first module. \r\n\r\nSpecial
    thanks to my Fiance, Prissy who was the idea creator of this mod, and did the
    graphic designing for it.\r\n\r\nAfter learning how to mod, I now have a understanding
    of what modders go through. I have a deep appreciation for them for the free content
    they make and the new ideas they come up with. It surely taken me a week to finally
    get this done and that was only 1 module using simple mechanics.\r\n\r\ngithub:
